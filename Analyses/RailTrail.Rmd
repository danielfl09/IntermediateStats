<!-- Instructions

1. Use the RailTrail dataset in R to come up with a question that can be answered with a t Test. 

2. Establish why the question is interesting and rephrase the question using a statistical "null" and "alternative" hypothesis. (Hint, see the "Math 325 Notebook -> R Help -> R-Markdown Hints" page of your textbook for instructions on how to write mathematical hypotheses.)

3. Clearly answer your question using statistics. Be sure to compute a p-value and provide supporting numerical and graphical summaries.

For details about the RailTrail dataset type the command:
  > ?RailTrail 
into your Console and study the help file that appears. Also, if you want extra information, browse this document that has images and further details:
http://www.northamptonma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5244   


Note: you can create "groups" from the data in many ways. For example, you can create a variable in your RailTrail dataset that is called "rain" and has categories of "yes" and "no" with the code:

```{r}
RailTrail$rain <- ifelse(RailTrail$precip > 0, "yes", "no")
```
